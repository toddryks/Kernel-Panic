# Project 2:  System Calls, Kernel Modules & Schedulers
# Developers:  Edward Skrod, Todd Ryks

#########################################################

=== SUMMARY ===
Part 1:  
    A C program that uses exactly 20 more system calls than are used in an empty program. On the MCH202 lab computers, an empty C program has exactly 26 system calls. Our program, tracetest, produces 46 system calls.

Part 2:
    A kernel module that creates a virtual file with the current date. This virtual file is called currentdate. It always contains the current time in the format year-month-day hour:minute:second.

=== COMPILATION ===
Part 1:
    1. cd src
    2. gcc -o tracetest tracetest.c
    3. sudo strace -o log ./tracetest

Part 2:
    1. cd src
    2. make
    3. sudo insmod date.ko
    4. cat /proc/currentdate
